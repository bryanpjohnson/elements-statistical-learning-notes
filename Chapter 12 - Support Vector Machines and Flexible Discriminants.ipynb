In a non-convex problem, there may be multiple feasible regions and multiple locally optimal points within each region.  It can take time exponential in the number of variables and constraints to determine that a non-convex problem is infeasible, that the objective function is unbounded, or that an optimal solution is the \"global optimum\" across all feasible regions.\n",
